	// tlsPassthroughListeners one: the pinned Cilium selects a
	// passthrough filter chain by SNI without the port, so a native
	// port is not the separation it looks like. Both halves of the
	// rule matter, and neither is the hostname's conflict winner:
	//
	// A TLSRoute attaches to a passthrough listener, where the backend
	// presents its own certificate and the Gateway terminates nothing.
	// Terminating its hostname ordered a certificate nobody serves.
	//
	// The passthrough listeners render from the spec alone, so the
	// collision does not need a TLSRoute to appear — an HTTPRoute
	// claiming <svc>.<apex> for a tlsPassthroughServices entry produces
	// the same pair. Deciding on the claiming route's kind would leave
	// that half open.
	//
	// Asking whether any claimant is an HTTPRoute, rather than whether
	// the winner is one, keeps a TLSRoute from starving an HTTPRoute of
	// its listener: resolveHostnameOwners ranks by namespace and name
	// with no notion of kind, and records same-namespace losers nowhere,
	// so a TLSRoute that merely sorted first would take the hostname
	// while the HTTPRoute still reported Accepted=True.
	//
	// Ownership still decides who is Accepted between routes: claims and
	// allRefs carry TLSRoutes untouched, so conflict resolution is
	// unaffected. Their RouteParentStatus is not untouched, though — a
	// TLSRoute is told below when no route of any kind can be served on
	// its hostname. An HTTPRoute claiming the same name puts a terminate
	// listener there, which the TLSRoute still cannot attach to, and
	// that gap predates this change.
	// Two views of the listeners the spec renders, taken from one
	// enumeration so a passthrough source added later reaches both or
	// neither. Native-port listeners admit only the tenant's own
	// namespace, while claims are collected from every attached
	// namespace, so a route elsewhere can claim a name it could never
	// attach to. The port-443 entries do not have this gap: their
	// allowedRoutes select on the gateway label, which every attached
	// namespace carries. tenantOnly is keyed by rendered hostname,
	// sections by rendered listener name, because a route pins itself to
	// a listener by name while a claim overlaps hostnames. Both are

		// terminate listener would put both chains on one SNI in the
		// one Envoy listener the Gateway becomes. Declaring the

		//
		// Several entries can match one claim. Reserved hostnames are
