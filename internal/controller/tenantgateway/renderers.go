//
// A TLSPassthroughServices entry shares port 443 with the terminate
// listeners, so a hostname claimed by both produces two listeners on one
// port under one name. Gateway API admits the pair and then requires both
// to report Conflicted, and neither serves.
//
// A TLSPassthroughListeners entry sits on its own port, and that is not
// the protection it looks like on the Cilium this repo pins. v1.19.5
// (packages/system/cilium/images/cilium/Dockerfile) translates the whole
// Gateway into a single Envoy listener and hangs the ports off
// AdditionalAddresses; toFilterChainMatch in
// operator/pkg/model/translation/envoy_listener.go matches on
// transport_protocol and server_names and nothing else, so the Gateway
// listener's port never reaches the match. Two chains carrying one SNI
// from two Gateway ports become two chains with identical criteria in one
// Envoy listener. Upstream says what that costs, in
// operator/pkg/model/model.go on v1.19.6, above NeedsCrossProtocolSplit:
// a combined Envoy listener "would otherwise erase the original Gateway
// listener port boundary and route traffic for one listener to another".
// v1.19.6 answers it by splitting the Envoy listeners per port when
// NeedsPerPortListeners holds, which needs a TLSRoute behind the
// native-port listener before that listener counts at all; v1.19.5
// has neither the split nor the diagnostic, so the answer here is to
// keep the pair from being rendered. Revisit when the pin moves.
//
// The cost is that an HTTPRoute claiming a hostname declared here gets
// no listener. Nothing hostile is needed to reach it:
// tlsPassthroughServices is a chart value shipped defaulted to api,
// vm-exportproxy and cdi-uploadproxy, so a tenant app named after one of
// them collides with a platform default. Suppression is not what breaks
// that hostname — before this filter the same collision rendered a
// terminate listener and a passthrough listener under one SNI, and
// which of them answered was not something the objects said — but it
// does take away the
// Conflicted condition, which was the one place the collision was
// visible on the Gateway. updateRouteStatuses puts it back on the route
// instead, as Accepted=False with NoMatchingListenerHostname naming the
// passthrough hostname that answers the claim.
//
// The caller matches a claimed hostname against these by SNI overlap
// rather than by equality, because a "*.db.<apex>" entry answers
// "pg.db.<apex>" on the pinned Cilium exactly as an explicit entry would:
// the filter chain match carries ServerNames and no port. Comparing by
// equality leaves that pair rendered and exposed to the translation this
// filter exists to avoid. Withdrawing the whole subtree is the intended
